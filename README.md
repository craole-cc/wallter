# Wallter: Redefine Your Desktop with Dynamic Wallpaper Alteration

Unlock the full potential of your desktop with **Wallter**, the innovative application designed to empower you to **alter** your wallpapers dynamically. This includes future capabilities to apply direct image changes, such as grayscale, mosaic effects, and more, before setting the wallpaper. Starting as a robust command-line tool, **Wallter** is set to expand its reach with future graphical (GUI) and web-based interfaces, providing a seamless and highly personalized environment on any platform.

## Motivation

**Wallter** was born out of a desire for a truly cross-platform, highly customizable, and automated wallpaper management solution. Existing tools often fall short in specific environments or lack the flexibility needed for power users:

* **Variety (Linux):** While a great tool, it often struggles with Wayland, limiting its utility for users on modern Linux desktops and is not available on Windows.
* **John's Background Switcher (Windows):** A popular choice, but its lack of a command-line interface and limited automation capabilities hinder advanced customization and integration into automated workflows.

**Wallter** aims to fill these gaps by providing:

* **Native Cross-Platform Support:** Built with Rust, `wallter` is designed from the ground up to work seamlessly across Windows, macOS, and Linux (including Wayland environments), ensuring a consistent experience regardless of your operating system.
* **Automation at its Core:** Its CLI-first design allows for easy integration into scripts, cron jobs, and custom automation routines, giving you unprecedented control.
* **The Power of Rust:** Leveraging Rust's performance, safety, and robust ecosystem allows for a reliable and efficient application, while also serving as a personal project to expand a Rust-based `dotfiles` ecosystem.

## Features

* **Dynamic Wallpaper Sourcing:** Seamlessly downloads and sets high-quality wallpapers from various online sources, starting with **Wallhaven**.
* **Local Image Integration:** Utilize your personal image collections by designating custom directories for wallpaper selection.
* **Intelligent Multi-Monitor Support:** Optimizes wallpaper display across diverse monitor setups, intelligently adapting to different resolutions, orientations, and positions.
* **Automated Workflow Customization:** Execute custom commands both before and after setting wallpapers, allowing for personalized automation of your desktop environment.
* **Advanced Content Curation:** Fine-tune your wallpaper discovery with granular search parameters for supported APIs, ensuring you find exactly what you're looking for.
* **Smart Caching:** Efficiently stores downloaded wallpapers locally for faster access and offline use, enhancing performance for features like slideshows.
* **Wallpaper Alterations (Planned):** Future versions will include the ability to apply direct image changes, such as grayscale, mosaic effects, and adding captions/watermarks, before setting the wallpaper.

## Configuration

The core of **Wallter**'s customization lies in its `config.toml` file. By default, **Wallter** sets up its primary directories within your user's `Pictures` directory for cross-platform simplicity and ease of access. For example, on Windows, this might be `C:\Users\{Username}\Pictures\Wallter\`, and on Linux, `~/Pictures/Wallter/`.

You can customize the following settings to tailor **Wallter** to your precise needs:

* `home_dir`: The root directory for **Wallter**'s operations, containing subdirectories for downloads, favorites, and current wallpapers.
* `api_key`: Your API key for integrated services (e.g., Wallhaven API key).
* `downloads_dir`: The designated local directory where **Wallter** will store downloaded wallpapers.
* `favorites_dir`: A dedicated directory for wallpapers you've marked as favorites.
* `wallpaper_dir`: The directory where the currently set wallpaper(s) are managed.
* `config_name`: The base name of the configuration file (e.g., "config").
* `config_type`: The format type of the configuration file (e.g., "toml", "json").
* `config_file`: The constructed full path to the configuration file.
* `custom_commands`: A list of shell commands to execute before and after a wallpaper is set, enabling dynamic actions.
* `monitors`: A detailed list defining each connected monitor by ID, name, resolution, orientation, scale, and position, allowing for precise multi-monitor control.
* `slideshow_interval`: The duration (as an integer) to wait between each image change during a slideshow.
* `slideshow_unit`: The unit of time for `slideshow_interval` (e.g., "seconds", "minutes", "hours").
